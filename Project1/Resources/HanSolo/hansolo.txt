Author's notes (and excuses):  

This was my first shot at a soft-body character model.  Boba Fett was 
semi-soft bodied, but mostly covered in hard armor, but this was my
first attempt at a fully soft-bodied character, and in Lightwave
this time.  Skeletal deformation and inverse kinematics are the ONLY
way to do this kinda thing :)

Since the Q2PMP poly limit is 800, I shot for spending every single poly
I could, and nailed it right at 800 for both tris and weapon models.  To
my own suprise, I managed to model both hands with 5 seperated and 
jointed fingers each.  This made for some nice animation possibilities
(that are probably too subtle for Q2 games, but at least WE know they're
there).  Han scratches his chin on the stand animation, actually grips
his gun, flexes his fingers, does a real flipoff, point, and twirls his 
gun into his holster.

This is the first *realistic* attempt at getting a likeness of a real person
on a Q2 PPM that I know of, and it was a bit of a challenge.  I went through
23 versions of the base model before I finally got the proportions right and
a decent likeness in the face.  Tweaking the head shape and hair shape with 
limited poly geometry was tricky, but the end result is pretty good IMHO. (at
least from the front, but what do you want...)  The size ends up looking kinda
small in the game, but he's actually slightly taller than the standard male
model.  It's just that the Han Solo model has realistic proportions of circa
1977 Harrisson Ford, who was pretty lean and had a big head of hair. 
The standard male model, OTOH, is a rediculously muscle-bound pinhead, so 
they look pretty strange standing next to each other.  

I did my homework when animating this character (not a chore, since I'm a
HUGE Star Wars fan), and really studied Han Solo's motions.  If you look 
at things like the run animation and think they look goofy... spend some
time watching Han Solo run in the movies, and you'll see how well it's
been emulated :)  The only thing I couldn't bring myself to emulate is
Harry's limp-wristed handling of his blaster- it's obvious upon studying
the movies frame-by-frame that Harry never fired a gun in his life, so he
flops his blaster around in his hand like it's a toy. I had to make Han a 
little tougher than that :]

So, with all the work behind me now... I can't wait to pop on a Q2 server
and find a Boba Fett ppm chasing around a Han Solo ppm!  "Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold" =)

Oh yeah, and for those that don't know... I've been working as a freelance 
contractor doing art for 3d games for the last year, and I'm always 
looking out for new employment opportunities.  So if you're interested...
